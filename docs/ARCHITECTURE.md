# Architecture

Quick reference for how this codebase is organized. For the full product roadmap, see
[`../Luxury-Lehenga-Master-Build-Plan.md`](../Luxury-Lehenga-Master-Build-Plan.md).

## Route groups

`src/app` is split into four route groups that map to the four audiences of the platform:

- `(storefront)` — public marketing/shopping site, wrapped in `SiteHeader`/`SiteFooter`.
- `(auth)` — sign in / sign up / password reset, centered minimal shell.
- `(account)` — logged-in customer dashboard (Module 2). Gated: any signed-out request redirects
  to `/login`.
- `(admin)` — admin dashboard (Module 2 gate; full dashboard is Module 16+). Gated: requires a
  `profiles.role` of `admin`, `staff`, or `production`.

## Auth (Module 2)

- `middleware.ts` lives at **`src/middleware.ts`**, not the project root — Next.js requires this
  when a `src` directory is used, otherwise the file is silently never invoked. (This was a
  pre-existing Module 0 bug that only surfaced once middleware needed to actually gate routes.)
  It refreshes the Supabase session cookie on every request, then redirects unauthenticated
  requests to `(account)`/`(admin)` to `/login`, and redirects non-staff roles away from
  `(admin)`.
- Route groups also re-check auth/role server-side in their own `layout.tsx`
  (`(account)`, `(admin)`) — defense in depth, since Server Components render independently of
  middleware.
- `lib/auth/session.ts` — `getAuthUser()`/`getProfile()` helpers used by pages/layouts instead of
  querying Supabase directly.
- `features/auth/actions.ts` — Server Actions for sign up/in/out and password reset, using the
  SSR client only (never the browser client for these).
- `src/app/auth/callback/` (`page.tsx` + `callback-client.tsx`) — lands signup-confirmation and
  password-reset email links. This is a **client** page, not a server route handler: Supabase's
  default email templates link through Supabase's own `/verify` endpoint, which mints the session
  itself and redirects back with `access_token`/`refresh_token` in the URL *fragment*
  (`#access_token=...`) rather than a `?code=` query param — fragments never reach the server, so
  a server route can never see them. `exchangeCodeForSession`/`code` is the right pattern for
  OAuth-provider redirects, not this project's email-link flow (no OAuth providers are used here
  anyway). `callback-client.tsx` reads the fragment client-side and calls the browser client's
  `setSession()`, which also syncs the session into cookies for the server to see on the next
  request. Confirmed against live Supabase with `scripts/test-email-flows.mjs`, which generates
  real confirmation/recovery links via the admin API and replays the exact redirect chain a
  browser would follow.
- Role changes on `profiles.role` are enforced by a trigger
  (`prevent_role_self_promotion`, `supabase/migrations/0017`/`0018`), not a column-level
  `REVOKE` — Postgres column privileges are additive on top of table-level grants, so a
  column-level `REVOKE` cannot restrict a broader table-level `GRANT UPDATE` once one exists
  (see `0014_grants.sql`). The trigger must be `SECURITY INVOKER`, not `SECURITY DEFINER` —
  inside a `SECURITY DEFINER` function, `current_user` resolves to the function's *owner*, not
  the actual caller, which silently defeated the first version of this check.

## `lib/` layering

- `lib/supabase/` — the only place Supabase clients are constructed. `client.ts` for Client
  Components, `server.ts` for Server Components/Actions, `middleware.ts` for the session-refresh
  and route-protection helper used by `src/middleware.ts`, `admin.ts` for the service-role client
  (server-only, never imported by client code).
- `lib/auth/` — server-only session/profile helpers built on top of `lib/supabase/server.ts`.
- `lib/validations/` — zod schemas, one file per feature area (`auth.ts`, `customers.ts`, …),
  shared between Server Actions and (where useful) client-side form checks.
- `lib/config/` — centralized, typed config (brand name, description, URL) so components never
  hardcode brand strings. Values here are developer defaults until Admin-configurable settings
  ship in Module 3/25.
- `lib/logger.ts` — thin logging wrapper so server code never leaks raw errors to the client;
  swap the implementation for a real provider later without touching call sites.

## Forms without `useActionState`

The project pins `react`/`react-dom` to `^18` (a documented Module 0 deviation from the plan's
Next.js 14 default, now on Next.js 15) — `useActionState`/`useFormState` aren't available on
stable React 18. Forms instead use a `"use client"` wrapper calling a `"use server"` action
directly inside `useTransition`, with local `useState` for the error message. See
`src/app/(auth)/login/login-form.tsx` for the reference pattern.

## Provider abstractions

Per the Master Build Plan's free-first policy, payments, notifications, shipping, and AI are each
built behind a provider interface with a mock/free implementation during development, so a real
provider can be swapped in later without changing calling code. These land in their respective
modules (11, 15, 14, 22) — nothing is implemented yet.

## Theming

All colors, radii, and fonts are CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css` and mapped into
Tailwind's theme in `tailwind.config.ts` — components should always use the semantic Tailwind
classes (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, etc.), never raw color values, so the palette can
become Admin-configurable later without touching component code.
